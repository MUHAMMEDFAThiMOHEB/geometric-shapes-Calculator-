Hello friend

in this project, I'm trying to write a program to calculate the parameter and the area of any regular shape
in arabic(اى شكل منتظم و الدائرة فقط) like square or rectangel beside one unregular shape which is circle
as a start tha application will be some shapes as initiation phase
then new shapes and features will be add In sequence

Q1- first question came in my mind should i make one class for all and function for each shape, or class for each one
    chatGPT says the best practics is a perant class and chiled class for each shape
    I'd preferr to create one class for regular shpes and another one for unregular shpes

Note: 
I think i need to review some math functions and topics
define/determine the stucture that i will implement
maybe i will build many versions of this app

decided that the project will contain only [square, triangle, rectangel, rhombus].
in the future, new shapes will be added, and other improvments 

--> the super class created
--> square class created
--> take_user_choise function generated
--> choicess function generated
--> add information of all included shapes as a comment

### Sat 3/5/2025 ###

--> build Triangle class
--> customize Square class

### Sun 4/5/2025 ###

--> build the (Rectangle, Rhombus, Circle) classes
--> update the archive

the next step is handle the work flow
handle and customize program behaviour
