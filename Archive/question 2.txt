### 🔁 1. **Why Inherit If We're Rewriting?**

You're not inheriting to reuse the code inside the methods. You're inheriting to reuse the **interface** (method names and expectations), and to enforce a **common structure** across all shapes.

The `GeometricShape` class says:

> "Every shape must have an `area()` and a `perimeter()` method."

That makes it a kind of **contract**. So even if each shape implements these differently, they are guaranteed to **behave similarly**.

---

### ✅ 2. **What This Enables: Polymorphism**

You can treat different shapes (e.g. `Square`, `Circle`, `Triangle`) the **same way** in your code.

Here’s a small example to demonstrate that:

```python
shapes = [Square(5), Square(10)]

for shape in shapes:
    print("Perimeter:", shape.perimeter())
    print("Area:", shape.area())
```

You don’t need to know *which* shape you’re dealing with — as long as it **inherits from `GeometricShape`** and **implements** those two methods, you can work with all of them the same way.

This is called **polymorphism**, and it’s a powerful idea in object-oriented programming.

### 🧱 3. **Why Not Use Just Separate Classes Without a Parent?**

You could define `Square`, `Circle`, `Triangle`, etc. all independently without a parent. But then:

- You can't treat them all the same in generic code.
- You can't enforce that each class has `area()` and `perimeter()`.
- You can't guarantee consistency in names or method behavior.
- You lose organization and clarity, especially as the project grows.

The parent class **organizes your design** and lets you write more flexible and scalable code.

---

### 🔧 4. **Real-World Analogy**

Think of `GeometricShape` as a **blueprint**. Every specific shape (square, circle, etc.) is a **different house built from that blueprint**, with some customizations.

You must "rebuild" certain parts (like walls and doors), but the **foundation** and **rules** are the same. That makes it easier to work with, maintain, and expand.

---

### ✅ Summary

Inheritance in this case is **not about avoiding repetition of code** — it's about:

- Enforcing a consistent interface (`area()`, `perimeter()`)
- Allowing polymorphism (treating all shapes the same way)
- Organizing your code for growth and scalability

Let me know if you'd like a live example where we use multiple shapes with a loop to demonstrate the power of inheritance and polymorphism!
