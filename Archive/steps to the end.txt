Hello friend

in this project, I'm trying to write a program to calculate the parameter and the area of any regular shape
in arabic(اى شكل منتظم و الدائرة فقط) like square or rectangel beside one unregular shape which is circle

Q1- first question came in my mind should i make one class for all and function for each shape, or class for each one
    chatGPT says the best practics is a perant class and chiled class for each shape
    I'd preferr to create one class for regular shpes and another one for unregular shpes
